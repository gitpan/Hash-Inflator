NAME
    Hash::Inflator - Access hash entries through methods

VERSION
    version 1.100820

SYNOPSIS
        my %h = (
            persons => [
                {
                    last_name  => 'Shindou',
                    first_name => 'Hikaru',
                },
                {
                    last_name  => 'Touya',
                    first_name => 'Akira',
                },
            ],
            # ...
        );

        my $obj = Hash::Inflator->new(%h);
        print $obj->persons->[0]->first_name;

DESCRIPTION
    This class can inflate a hash so that you can access it using methods
    instead of plain hash keys. So instead of "$x->{foo}" you can do
    "$x->foo()".

    Why would we want to do this?

    First, because this way you can quickly prototype a class. Your class
    can inherit from Hash::Inflator and the code using your class can just
    assume the attributes are there. You can bother with writing the methods
    later. Although tools like Class::Accessor and friends make this very
    easy anyway.

    Second, because we can.

    You can call any method on the object. If the name corresponds to a hash
    key, its value will be returned. If there is no such key, "undef" will
    be returned. If the hash contains other hashes (however deep down),
    those will become inflated as well.

    The code has been taken, with very little adaption, from Net::Jaiku by
    Rick Measham, with his permission.

METHODS
  new
    Takes a hash or a hash ref and returns the inflated hash as a reference.
